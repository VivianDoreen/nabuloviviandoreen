        Hello! <br />
        <p>
          My name is Nabulo Vivian Doreen, A Front End Developer , graduate of
          bachelor of science in software engineering at Makerere University,
          Uganda. I describe myself as a developer who loves coding, open
          source, and enjoy working with others. Professionally, I have worked
          with Andela Uganda Limited. In my spare time I like to create and
          contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a lot of
          new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects.
       
        </p>
        <p>
          I have commercial experience providing front-end development,
          producing high quality responsive websites and exceptional user
          experience. Clients often approach me when they need a developer who
          can provide:
          <ul>
            <li>Responsive HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript (vanilla, React/Redux, jQuery, etc)</li>
            <li>High-level user experience</li>
            <li>Best practices </li>
            <li>Performance</li>
            <li>Git</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The work I provide is of highest quality, fully responsive, and
            tested in a wide range of devices. I take great care to ensure each
            project is well-documented and easily maintainable so you can
            enhance a website as your company grows. Often front-end development
            of a website is overlooked, but being the part of your project that
            combines design, back-end development and the layer that your users
            interact with, from my experience, it is the most important to get
            right. My clients have found that launching with a well considered
            and well developed front-end has saved them time and money and makes
            for a product that is consistently of high quality.
